This dataset includes some properties that are not properly classified as public open space, so I filtered the dataset using SQL to exclude the following categories of DPR properties (as described in DPR’s Parks Properties dataset user guide):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCemetery\nStandalone facility\n\n\nStrip\nNarrow, linear grass or paved area border or marginal property found in conjunction with the arterial street system and having no recreation or park equipment.\n\n\nUndeveloped\nVacant, unimproved area of land which does not constitute a natural area and has no recreation or park equipment.
